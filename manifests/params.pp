# == Class: gerrit::params
#
# This class manages Gerrit parameters
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*auth_type*]
#   The authentication type that gerrit should use. Default OpenID. See
#   the Gerrit documentation for valid types
#
# [*user*]
#   The user that Gerrit runs as
#
# [*basepath*]
#   The base location where Gerrit will store the git repositories
#
# [*gerrit_version*]
#   The version of Gerrit to download
#
# [*download_location*]
#   Where to download the gerrit war file from
#
# [*install_git*]
#   Should git be installed? (NOTE: A git installation is required for
#   Gerrit to operate. If true [the default] then ::git will be included
#   during the install phase. The expected puppet module is
#   puppetlabs/git)
#
# [*install_gitweb*]
#   Should gitweb be installed? This defaults to true.
#
# [*install_java*]
#   Should java be installed? (NOTE: java >= 1.7 is required for Gerrit
#   to operate. This flag which defaults to true indicates if the module
#   will do an include of ::java. The expected puppet module is the
#   puppetlabs/java module)
#
# [*manage_database*]
#   Should databases be managed? If set to true (the default) than if
#   MySQL or PostgreSQL are detected resources will be exported as
#   appropriate.
#
# [*manage_firewall*]
#   Should firewall rules be managed? If set to true (the default) then
#   firewall rules for the Gerrit webUI and SSH will be added via the
#   puppetlabs/firewall syntax
#
# [*manage_site_skin*]
#   Should we push Gerrit site skinning files to the system. If set to
#   true (the default) then the gerrit_site_options hash passed to the
#   base class definition will define where to find the proper files. If
#   no files are defined via the has then default "blank" files will be
#   pushed so that Gerrit does not need to be restarted should you later
#   decide to add skins.
#
# [*manage_static_site*]
#   Should we manage the contents of ${gerrit_home}/static?
#
# [*service_enabled*]
#   Should the Gerrit service be enabled? If true (the default) then the
#   service will be configured to start during boot as force started.
#
#   Valid options are:
#     true: the default - configure the service to start on boot and
#     force start the service on puppet runs
#
#     false: service is ensured stopped and disabled for reboot
#
#     manual: service is configured as a manual service, refreshes /
#     notifications will behave per normal when the service is
#     configured with enable => manual. The service is not specifically
#     started or stopped during system boot.
#
# [*default_options*]
#   The default options for a Gerrit system. It is expected that the
#   class will be handed a override_options hash which expands or
#   completely replaces the defaults defined here
#
# [*default_secure_options*]
#   The default secure options for a Gerrit system. It is expected that
#   the class will be handed a override_secure_options. The
#   auth.registerEmailPrivateKey and auth.restTokenPrivateKey options
#   are required. If set to 'GENERATE' (the default) then a system
#   idempotent system locked "random" string will be generated. It is
#   recommended that these values be overriden with custom strings, but
#   for ease of setup this system was developed.
